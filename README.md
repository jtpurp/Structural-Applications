# Unsymmetric-Bending-Design

Doubly, Singly, & Unsymmetric Cross-Sections

Purpose

Calculates maximum stress in beam experiencing unsymmetric bending

Assumptions

1. Simply supported beam

2. Loading:

      -Distributed load with the same (w1=w2) or different magnitudes (w1≠w2) at starting (z1) and ending (z2) positions measured from the left along the span of the beam
          
      -Point load with position (z) measured from the left along span of the beam
          
3. Select origin at any location on cross-section for determining location of centroid

4. Positive x-direction to the left and positive y-direction downward in relation to the centroid and when considering loading direction

5. Use Goal Seek to determine location of max moment, z (m) when given a distributed load by setting cell M52 (V (kN)) equal to zero (0) by changing cell M55 (z (m))

6. Calculator able to consider up to 4 rectangular segments of cross-section
